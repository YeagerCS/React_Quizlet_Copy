create user interface design for ideas
(
    mainform with nav: Home.jsx,
    new words pairs: NewWords.jsx,
    word pair array access: WordPairs.jsx
)

structurize code into different files === plan structure of the application (easier implementation)

add randomizing -> localStorage

create form to add unlimited elements to an array with translation

add multiple arrays and store them in localStorage
access any word pairs

export added arrays to json files

(no-sql database) -- (RavenDB/MongoDB)?
